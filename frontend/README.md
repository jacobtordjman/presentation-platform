## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Node.js
- MongoDB

### Steps

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/presentation-management-system.git
   cd presentation-management-system
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Set up the environment variables. Create a `.env` file in the root directory:
   ```plaintext
   MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/presentationDB
   PORT=3001
   ```

4. Start the backend server:
   ```bash
   npm run server
   ```

5. Start the frontend development server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

## Code Quality & Conventions

- **Component Structure**: The components are divided into small, reusable pieces to make them maintainable and scalable.
- **CSS Organization**: Styles are organized by component, ensuring that the styling is modular and easy to manage.
- **Error Handling**: API calls handle errors gracefully and provide feedback to the user.
- **Debounce Implementation**: For better performance, you should consider implementing debounce where necessary, especially in search or auto-save functionalities.

## Future Improvements

- **Containerization**: Dockerize the application for easier deployment and development.
- **Testing**: Add unit tests and integration tests to ensure code reliability.
- **Authentication**: Implement user authentication to secure the application.
